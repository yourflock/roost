## Purpose

Configuration templates for device identity, ingest targets, and runtime knobs.

## Expected Contents

- tests and fixtures relevant to this domain
- local configuration templates where required
- domain-specific docs updates when behavior changes

## Integration Contracts

- align with top-level app README and docs
- consume shared contracts from backend where relevant
- maintain clear boundaries to avoid cross-domain coupling

## Next Implementation Steps

Create schema-validated config templates for local and production.
