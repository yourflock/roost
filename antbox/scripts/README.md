# antbox/scripts

## Purpose

Operational scripts for setup, diagnostics, and controlled maintenance operations.

## Expected Contents

- tests and fixtures relevant to this domain
- local configuration templates where required
- domain-specific docs updates when behavior changes

## Integration Contracts

- align with top-level app README and docs
- consume shared contracts from backend where relevant
- maintain clear boundaries to avoid cross-domain coupling

## Next Implementation Steps

Implement scripts for setup, tuner diagnostics, and safe update procedures.
