# Owl Addon API

Roost integrates with Owl via the Community Addon API. When a user adds their Roost
server URL in Owl (Settings > Sources > Add Roost), Owl fetches the manifest and
presents all available content in the unified library.

Service: `server/services/owl_api` — runs on port 8091.

---

## Authentication

The API uses a two-step token model:

1. **API token** — long-lived token generated by the user in Roost (Settings > API Tokens).
   The user enters this in Owl once to link their account.
2. **Session token** — short-lived (4 hours) token issued by `/owl/auth`. Owl exchanges
   the API token for a session token and uses the session token for all subsequent requests.
